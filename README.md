## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that my software is functional and secure through testing. During development, it is important to implement some kind of testing to ensure the code functions as intended. For this project specifically, unit testing was implemented using the JUnit library. Every component had tests written for it in order to ensure that proper restrictions on input were enforced. For example, tests were written to ensure `Task` could not have a `null` id.


## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

User needs were incorporated by first deciding what useful information needed to be stored and used throughout the application. As an example, the `Contact` class stores user information such as name, phone and address.


## How do I approach designing software?

My approach to designing software changes depending on the scope of the project. I believe that as a developer, it is important to understand and choose the tools that are appropriate for the project. Personally, I like to begin by prototyping a small version of the application first before any real code is written. This lets me get a feel for what will be required of the project as devlopment goes on. I then choose the tools based off of this initial prototyping stage and begin development.
